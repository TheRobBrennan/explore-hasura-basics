# Welcome

This project was created to follow along with [Hasura Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/).

## Scratchpad

### Deploy Hasura

Click [https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku) for a one-click deployment to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

All you have to do is:

- Specify an app name (e.g. `rb-learn-hasura-back-end`)
- Click `Deploy app`

To view your app, simply use your app name - `rb-learn-hasura-back-end` in my case - and go to [https://rb-learn-hasura-back-end.herokuapp.com/console](https://rb-learn-hasura-back-end.herokuapp.com/console) to view the Hasura console.
